# Producer-Consumer_pattern
## What it is about?
* Simple program that will create:
* 2 users
* Put them in to a MySql database
* Print all users from the DB
* Deletes all users
* Print all data from DB once again!

##  Chalinges for me :
* Do not use spring framework since I work in it from the beginning
* Lear and implement in a few days Producer-Consumer pattern
* Try Junit testing on void methods
* Connect to an external DB
* Use hibernate as communicator to my DB
